Justice Secretary Menardo Guevarra said he \u201cstrongly\u201d supported the call and affirmed the \u201cethical and legal basis\u201d laid down by the Philippine Medical Association and the Data Privacy Commission to justify waiving the medical confidential rule \u201cin times of public health emergency.\u201d\n\n\n\nHe also strongly supports the call of the Integrated Bar of the Philippines on COVID-19 positive individuals and PUIs \u201cfor the waiver of confidentiality of their medical condition,\u201d Guevarra told reporters on Sunday.\n  \n\n\u201cThis will enable other people they have been in close contact with to take the necessary precautions or remedial measures to protect themselves, without having to further burden the Department of Health with the tedious task of contact tracing,\u201d he added.\n\nThe three medical and legal groups made the appeal in a joint statement on April 4, three weeks since the enhanced community quarantine to contain the outbreak.\n\nIn justifying their call to waive the medical confidentiality rule, they reported increasing incidents in which COVID-19 patients continue to withhold their true medical condition when seeking treatment or hospital admission \u201cthereby compromising the health institutions and the health workers,\u201d many of whom have died or fell ill from the infectious disease.\n\nEven without the individual waiver, they said, existing laws and rules grant the government \u201csufficient authority and basis\u201d to lift the confidentiality of the medical condition of COVID-19 patients and PUIs.\n\nThese include Republic Act 11332 or the 2018 Law on Reporting of Communicable Diseases, which makes illegal the \u201cnon-cooperation of persons and entities\u201d in times of public health emergencies.\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\nThe confidentiality of a patient\u2019s medical data and details is \u201cnot absolute\u201d and can be lifted \u201cwhen the public health and safety so demand\u201d or \u201cwhen the patient waives his right,\u201d the three groups pointed out.\n\nArticle III Section 3 of the Code of Ethics of the Medical Profession, they said, exempts a physician from keeping private and highly confidential a person\u2019s medical information \u201cwhen required by law, ordinance or administrative order in the promotion of justice, safety and public health.\u201d\n\nThe Health Privacy Code specifying the Joint Administrative Order No. 2016-0002 or the privacy guidelines for the implementation of the Philippine Health Information Exchange, also allows that \u201cin case of emergency where time is of the essence, disclosure may be made even without court order.\u201d\n\n  \n           \n\n\n\n Subscribe to Notifications\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  Unsubscribe from Notifications\n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n    \n\n    \n\n    \n\t\n\t\n\t  \n\n    \n\t\n\n    \n    Outbrain"}

It\u2019s good to pause and see how is the Lord coming to us during these days,\u201d he added.\n\nThis Holy Week is a good time to reflect on why Jesus suffered so much and that his suffering should \u201clead us to sorrow and gratitude\u2014sorrow for our sins, for our indifference, and gratitude for his great love and solidarity with us,\u201d Pabillo said.\n\nNot less holy\n\n\u201cWe may be celebrating this year\u2019s Holy Week differently, but hopefully, more deeply,\u201d he said, adding that the absence of traditional religious activities does not make Holy Week less holy.\n\nLingayen-Dagupan Archbishop Socrates Villegas echoed Pabillo\u2019s views, saying Holy Week is about love, not rituals.\n\n\u201cLove makes us holy.

Two of the patient\u2019s family members had died from COVID-19, while the rest were recovering.\n  \n\n\u201cShe is isolated and alone in PGH, and cannot do anything. It\u2019s too sad to see patients like that. All I can offer is myself, a person who will listen to her,\u201d said Valdez.\n\nHealth workers get so invested in their work that they sometimes forget to take care of themselves, she said, and \u201cthis eventually leads to burnout and similar challenges.\u201d\n\nAnother source of anguish\n\nBut lately, another source of their mental anguish has surfaced \u2014 one that stalks nurses and health workers the moment they step out of the hospital.\n\nValdez has experienced it herself: One day as she walked home, her neighbors hurried back inside their houses, avoiding her like the plague. She has also heard stories of health workers being forced out of their rented places because of fear that they could infect the entire community.\n\n\u201cI know (people) are just being careful,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I wish they would be kinder and more considerate to us, especially during this time of crisis,\u201d Valdez said.\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\nSupport groups\n\nTo help themselves cope, nurses in the state-run hospital turn to their support group\u2014\u201cPGH Care Society\u201d\u2014to help each other out of emotional and psychological lows through professional and peer interventions.\n\nOther groups, such as Ugat Foundation and the University of the Philippines Diliman\u2019s PsycServ (UPD PsycServ), have been offering telepsychotherapy and psycho-emotional counseling services for front-line health workers and people experiencing stress or anxiety during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nLike other PGH nurses, Valdez has developed the fear of getting the virus and infecting others, as well as a sense of helplessness for not being able to do everything for the patients.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve also faced (cases of) infectious diseases in the past, but this is something that we didn\u2019t expect to blow up like this. It totally changed our working environment. There is fear, anxiety, and uncertainty all around,\u201d said Valdez, who lives with friends in Manila while her entire family is abroad.\n\nThe PGH Care Society, a mental health advocacy group whose members include Valdez, provides a platform for nurses to freely express their feelings as a form of unburdening and release. Through online exchanges, they can hopefully unload negative feelings and deal more strongly with \u201cone of the most challenging times of their career,\u201d Valdez said.\n\nOnline counseling\n\nUgat Foundation, meanwhile, is a group helping Filipino families, overseas Filipino workers (OFWs) and marginalized individuals cushion the physical and psychological impact of the coronavirus outbreak.\n\nOn April 2, it launched Ugat Sandaline, an online platform that provides psycho-emotional counseling services to people affected by the pandemic, especially medical front-liners and other responders deployed by the government.\n\n\u201cThey need a lot of support now, and hopefully, crisis counseling empowers them in their valiant efforts to fight COVID-19 and ensure the safety and health of the Filipino people,\u201d the group said.\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\nUgat Sandaline volunteers include psychologists, mental health professionals, and psychology graduate students who are trained to listen to and empathize with those needing emotional support, whether through video, voice call or online chat.\n\n\u201cIn cases such as pandemics, when compliance is critical to the nation\u2019s efforts to \u2018flatten the curve,\u2019 feeling heard or having an outlet to ventilate feelings will hopefully also enable more (people) to comply with national and local government efforts,\u201d the group said in a statement.\n\nFor other \u2018essential\u2019 workers\n\nA third help group, UPD PsycServ, has expanded its free telepsychotherapy services to reach out not only to health workers but also to persons under investigation or monitoring for coronavirus symptoms, and COVID-19-positive individuals and their relatives.\n\nIt also offers a comforting hand to security guards, store cashiers, janitors and other \u201cessential\u201d workers who still have to go to work\u2014and face the risk of being infected\u2014while the Luzon-wide lockdown is in effect.\n\nOnline sessions with the group can be scheduled through text, Viber or an online form posted on the group\u2019s Facebook page.\n\nSometimes a simple \u201ckumusta\u201d (how are you?) suffices to renew their strength, Valdez said.\n\n\u201cAs health workers, we\u2019re used to asking others: Kumusta ka? So it\u2019s time that we also take care of our fellow nurses and front-liners,\u201d she said. \u201cThat one simple question can totally change someone\u2019s perspective and feelings.\u201d\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n  \n           \n\n\n\n Subscribe to Notifications\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  Unsubscribe from Notifications\n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n    \n\n    \n\n    \n\t\n\t\n\t  \n\n    \n\t\n\n    \n    Outbrain"}

Internet trolls and other troublemakers have responded with \"Zoombombing\": joining Zoom meetings uninvited and disrupting them. Zoombombers have exposed themselves to schoolchildren and shouted racial slurs.\n\nIn a Friday statement, federal prosecutors in Michigan warned the public that Zoombombing isn't a harmless prank; it's a crime.\n\n\"Hackers are disrupting conferences and online classrooms with pornographic and/or hate images and threatening language,\" wrote the US Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Michigan. \"Anyone who hacks into a teleconference can be charged with state or federal crimes.\"\n\nPossible charges include \"disrupting a public meeting, computer intrusion, using a computer to commit a crime, hate crimes, fraud, or transmitting threatening communications,\" the prosecutors warn. All of these charges come with the potential for fines and jail time, the authorities say.\n\nThe exact charges a Zoombomber faces would presumably depend on how they gained access to a Zoom meeting and what they did to disrupt it. For example, some Zoom meetings are advertised publicly, which might make it hard to make a computer intrusion charge stick. But someone could still be prosecuted for things they said or did to disrupt the meeting after joining it.\n\n\u201cYou think Zoombombing is funny? Let\u2019s see how funny it is after you get arrested,\u201d Michigan US attorney Matthew Schneider said in Friday's release. \u201cIf you interfere with a teleconference or public meeting in Michigan, you could have federal, state, or local law enforcement knocking at your door.\u201d\n\nIn a recent story, Ars Technica security reporter Dan Goodin explained how Zoom users can protect themselves from Zoombombing attacks. He noted that meetings can be password-protected, and he advised against announcing login information on social media or other public channels.\n\nGoodin notes that hosts can disable Zoom's \"Join Before Host\" setting to ensure that the host is in control of a meeting from the outset. Zoom also has a \"waiting room\" feature, allowing a host to verify participants before allowing them to join the meeting."}

For an increasing number of Americans, that means a loved one.\n\nBehind the growing numbers of people who have died from COVID-19, there are friends and family members in mourning. Recently, Dickerson saw that sorrow up close when he spoke to a friend whose close family member died from the virus. He also saw the disconnect between what that family felt and the broader political debate occurring about the coronavirus.\n\nTo make sense of that clash, he wrote about it in an article for The Atlantic.\n\n\"The response has been pretty powerful, from all sorts of different people,\" Dickerson told 60 Minutes Overtime. \"And so a lot of people when they read it, passed it around, either because they were experiencing grief, or because they knew somebody that was, or because they were having a kind of anticipatory grief and sorrow about this confusing moment that we're all in.\"\n\nPart of what makes this moment so confusing, Dickerson said, is that people can no longer do what they usually do when a loved one dies. Due to social distancing and mandates against gatherings, they cannot have a funeral, nor hug relatives who have gathered. In most instances, they are not even able to be with their loved one in person before they die, especially if its due to COVID-19.\n\n\"All of the normal coping mechanisms are taken away,\" Dickerson said. \"And that is an acute situation for the people going through it, but also for the rest of us. This is something new for all of us to be experiencing this at the same time.\"\n\nFor Dickerson, that sense of unity in grief is what will help people get through it. He pointed to the collective applause that New Yorkers give at 7 pm each evening in thanks to health care workers who are taking care of the sick. The sounds of clapping hands and banging pots, he said, goes beyond the intended message.\n\n\"It's also all of us neighbors hearing each other, participating in that together, all having the same human reaction, regardless of our politics or our creed or our religions or races or where we come from, that we're all expressing the same kind of gratitude at the same time,\" he said, \"which is not only a good thing to be doing collectively, but it also reminds us all that we, at the very basic level, are all human beings.\"\n\nThe video above was produced by Brit McCandless Farmer and Sarah Shafer Prediger.

The first animal started showing symptoms on March 27, and all are doing well and expected to recover, a zoo spokesman said. The zoo has been closed to the public since March 16 amid the surging coronavirus outbreak in New York.\n\u201cThese are extremely hard days for all of us \u2013 no matter where we live and work. We will ensure that whatever we can learn from these circumstances will be used to better understand and combat this disease,\u201d zoo director Jim Breheny said in a statement.\nThe finding raises new questions about transmission of the virus in animals. The US Department of Agriculture, which confirmed Nadia\u2019s test result at its veterinary lab, says there are no known cases of the virus in US pets or livestock.\n\u201cThere doesn\u2019t appear to be, at this time, any evidence that suggests that the animals can spread the virus to people or that they can be a source of the infection in the United States,\u201d Dr Jane Rooney, a veterinarian and a USDA official, said in an interview.\nA USDA spokesperson said on Sunday it was not recommending routine coronavirus testing of animals in zoos or elsewhere or of zoo employees. Still, DR Rooney said a small number of animals in the US had been tested through the USDA\u2019s National Veterinary Services Laboratories, and all those tests came back negative except Nadia\u2019s.\nThe coronavirus outbreaks around the world are driven by person-to-person transmission, experts say.\nThere have been a handful of reports outside the US of pet dogs or cats becoming infected after close contact with contagious people, including a Hong Kong dog that tested positive for a low level of the pathogen in February and early March. Hong Kong agriculture authorities concluded that pet dogs and cats couldn\u2019t pass the virus to human beings but could test positive if exposed by their owners.\nSome researchers have been trying to understand the susceptibility of different animal species to the virus and to determine how it spreads among animals, according to the Paris-based World Organisation for Animal Health. The American Veterinary Medical Association and the federal Centres for Disease Control and Prevention have been recommending that out of an abundance of caution, people ill with the coronavirus should limit contact with animals \u2013 advice that the veterinary group reiterated after learning of the tiger\u2019s test result.\nIn general, the CDC also advises people to wash their hands after handling animals and do other things to keep pets and their homes clean. At the Bronx Zoo, Nadia, her sister Azul, two Amur tigers and three African lions developed dry coughs, and some of the cats exhibited some wheezing and loss of appetite, said Dr Paul Calle, the zoo\u2019s chief veterinarian.\nOnly Nadia was tested because it takes anaesthesia to get a sample from a big cat. Her temperature was taken at the same time, and it was normal, Dr Calle said. The seven sickened cats live in two areas at the zoo, and the animals had contact with the same worker, who is doing OK, zoo officials said. They said they are taking \u201cappropriate preventive measures\u201d for the staffers who care for the ailing animals, and there are no signs of illness in other big cats on the property.\nFor most people, the coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms, such as a fever and cough that clear up in two to three weeks. For some, especially older adults, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia, and can be fatal."}

Cities4Life had three members present at the clinic and a mobile ultrasound unit attended by two members, according to Benham, while about 15 police officers were at the scene.

Eiselt, who did not respond to a request for comment from the DCNF, noted in another tweet that pro-lifers had been protesting at a Planned Parenthood clinic.\n  Neither Charlotte Mayor Vi Lyles nor the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Department replied to multiple requests for comment from the DCNF.

This is the reason that tonight's matches have been prerecorded and held in an empty WWE Performance Center - save for a few exceptions like the Boneyard and Firefly Fun House match.\nThat  being said, Ripley vs Flair was an incredibly well-performed match, with both Superstars attempting to put on a show worthy of a stadium of screaming fans. And that they did, with the majority of opinion expressed on social media sites like Twitter and Facebook expression their joy with the fight, and already calling it one of the best matches of the two nights so far.\nIn the meantime, we'll have to wait and see what kind of impression Flair makes on NXT now that she's the black and gold brand's reigning women's champion.\n\nPublished 06 Apr 2020, 05:23 IST\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFetching more content..."}

In Britain, where more than 47,000 people have been infected, Prime Minister Boris Johnson was admitted to a hospital for further testing 10 days after testing positive for the coronavirus.\nOfficial government guidance around controlling the spread of the coronavirus continues to be dynamic in the U.S., with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Friday adding a recommendation for Americans to wear cloth face coverings when leaving their homes.\nAnd U.S. leaders\u2019 rhetoric around the outbreak is still dire, with many Americans in states across the country preparing to remain under stay-in-place orders for at least the coming weeks.\nOn Sunday, U.S. Surgeon General Vice Admiral Jerome Adams told Fox News on Sunday that this coming week \u201cis going to be the hardest and the saddest week of most Americans\u2019 lives, quite frankly,\u201d adding that it will be \u201cour Pearl Harbor moment.\u201d He also noted in the interview, however, that Americans could \u201cchange the trajectory of this epidemic\u201d by following social distancing guidelines.\nAnd for equity markets, visibility as to the duration and extent of the outbreak would be a welcomed respite. Stocks ended last week lower as volatility returned to equity markets following the prior week\u2019s advances, as rapidly deteriorating economic data began to reflect the impact of the coronavirus outbreak. The March jobs report \u2013 which collected data just through about the 12th of the month \u2013 already showed U.S. employers cut 701,000 non-farm payrolls, before widespread social distancing measures had even gone into effect.\nWith this in mind, Thursday\u2019s initial jobless claims report will again be a closely watched print, with consensus economists expecting to see 5 million new unemployment claims filed for the week ended April 4. The prior week, jobless claims skyrocketed to a record 6.648 million.\n\u2014\n6:25 p.m. ET Sunday: Stock futures rise\nHere were the main moves during the overnight session for equity futures, as of 6:25 p.m. ET on Sunday:\nSP 500 futures (ES=F): up 37 points, or 1.49% to 2,519.75\n\nDow futures (YM=F):\u00a0up 288 points, or 1.37% to 21,245.00\n\nNasdaq futures (NQ=F):\u00a0up 125.5 points, or 1.67% to 7,648.25\n\n\n\u2014\n6:18 p.m. ET Sunday: Boeing extends closure of Puget Sound, Washington operations\nBoeing (BA) said in an announcement Sunday that it is extending the production facility closures at its Puget Sound, Washington-area facilities, \u201cin light of the company's continuing focus on the health and safety of employees, current assessment of the spread of COVID-19 in Washington state, the reliability of the supply chain and additional recommendations from government health authorities.\u201d\nPreviously, Boeing had anticipated a 14-day temporary suspension of these facilities in Washington state, starting March 25. At the time, Boeing said it would grant paid leave to employees who could not work from home for 10 days.

the system will not be able to provide them with the equipment they need to protect themselves and their patients during the COVID-19 pandemic are looking at ways to design and produce their own.\n\nDoctors are concerned about the availability of equipment to protect both themselves and patients, one Melbourne anaesthetist, who wished to remain anonymous, told the ABC.\n\n\"Many doctors and health professionals are very concerned and confused about the requirements for, and current supply of, personal protective equipment (PPE) for hospitals,\" she said.\n\n\"Some hospitals now have less than one week of available stock of this type of equipment to deal with any potential or known COVID-positive patients.\n\n\"This situation is applicable to normal or emergency surgery, emergency rooms and inpatient ward care, as well as the treatment of COVID-positive patients.\"\n\nA large centralised group involving Victorian university staff, clinicians and manufacturers has been working tirelessly to develop suitable products and to co-ordinate the supply and demand of these essential items, and it has begun to network with other similar groups across Australia and internationally.\n\nThey have reached out to philanthropical organisations and local engineers and manufacturers to open up supply lines and found them keen to help.\n\nThe PPE items they are working to create in order to reduce the risk to staff and secure their safety include:\n\nOn top of the doctors' efforts, a Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) task force has been established to assess this dynamic supply and demand situation, while the Federal Department of Industry, Science, Energy and Resources has set up a ventilator task force.\n\nAll DHHS-supplied equipment needs to be approved by the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA).\n\nThe TGA has created a rapid approval process to speed this up for COVID-related equipment.\n\nCon Kolivas, a retired anaesthetist and software engineer who is helping to coordinate one of the groups, said it started as a casual chat between a few people about the lack of ventilators in Italy at the time.\n\nThey wondered whether it would be possible for Australia to build some kind of simple ventilator in case of a shortage locally.\n\n\"The rate of infection of medical staff in the worst-affected areas overseas is now very high and, to make matters worse, doctors who've been infected at the front line appear to have a higher death rate than people who've caught it in the community,\" he said.\n\n\"I and others approached people from different disciplines in industry, medicine, engineering, software and so on about what we could do and found a cohort of people willing to help out.\n\n\"After the initial discussion about ventilators, talks turned to things we could manufacture locally and personal protective equipment (PPE) was top of the list.\n\n\"Government and health suppliers don't actually give us any of this sort of equipment, so we needed to innovate because there isn't an easy path to find these novel pieces of equipment.\"\n\nEmergency physician and intensive care fellow Arun Ilancheran said a severe shortage of equipment was looming.\n\n\"Our group feels is it imperative that we source local engineers and manufacturers to continue to have the supply chain of the essential equipment that we need to save lives during this pandemic.\n\n\"We are aware that as the lockdown phase gets stricter, we will have further supply chain issues.\"\n\nDr Kolivas said the Victorian Government was keen to support any firm designs the group could come up with, but for any complex designs, the regular government channels of approval and funding could slow things down.\n\nFortunately, various philanthropical organisations were also very willing to assist, he said.\n\n\"With the help of 3D printing it makes it possible to tackle any kind of design we want,\" Dr Kolivas said.\n\n\"The problem with 3D printing is it's slow, so it's great for producing the prototypes, but you can't mass produce them if each one takes two hours to print.\"\n\nThat is where support from local manufacturers comes in.\n\nDr Kolivas said that, again, there was a desire to help.\n\nToyota is one example of a company which has offered its design and engineering capabilities to produce equipment on a large scale.\n\nCrucially, Dr Kolivas said, ventilator manufacturer Medtronic had opened up one of its designs for free use during the pandemic, without intellectual property restrictions, meaning there was potential for manufacturers to produce the vital piece of equipment in Australia.\n\nA website, COVID SOS, has been set up as a central hub for the various groups out there working on novel solutions.\n\nIt is also trying to address frontline medical equipment shortages through community-sourced methods of design and manufacture.\n\nHere are some examples of the equipment the group is working on:\n\n\"The \"intubation box\" is an example of an alternative novel PPE to deal with the unique threat of coronavirus. When a patient is so severely affected by the respiratory complications that they need to be put on a ventilator, they need to have a tube put into their trachea to connect them up to the ventilator. That particular procedure puts the doctor (usually an anaesthetist, intensive care specialist, or emergency physician) and assisting staff in very close proximity with the patient's respiratory tract \u2014 they're literally staring down the patient's throat. The potential for aerosol exposure there is extreme, and our clinicians had seen perspex shells used overseas for that scenario to limit that exposure. We developed our own solution, as you can see in the diagram, where the patient is under perspex with rubber-like seals to drop around the patient, and it has self-sealing hand holes for the clinicians to do their intubation. The design was revised and simplified a few times and is made from laser-cut perspex, so is ultimately not that complex to build, which is important. It has been tested clinically with success already and we're looking to produce a number of these for multiple hospitals.\"\n\n\"The facial shield is a very simple guard to/from the staff member which provides an impermeable barrier to any aerosols being sprayed in either direction. It obviously doesn't provide a perfect airtight seal but it affords a great deal of confidence when performing procedures on infected patients. We were able to prototype these from an open-source design on the internet and 3D print them. 3D printing has allowed us to rapidly get a design built, so it allows for rapid prototyping, but is very slow in production. A local manufacturer has taken up the need for facial shield designs and has said they'll be able to produce them in the thousands. We have been connecting hospital networks with this manufacturer to allow them to test out their prototypes and they should be able to order them immediately.\""}

Across India, city corporations and police are tapping drone operators to better enforce the lockdown, spray disinfectants, identify clusters of people showing signs of sickness and for quick delivery of medicines and medical supplies.In the time of the Covid-19 virus outbreak, drones are being viewed as tools to limit human exposure.Firms such as Garuda Aerospace, Marut Drones, IIO Technologies, The Drone Federation of India and initiatives like Droneman.in are actively partnering with other firms to cater to the demand.Several of them have repurposed agricultural drones to spray disinfectants and are using micro drones with cameras to help police in surveillance. \"We've been working with the Telangana government for the past two weeks.
